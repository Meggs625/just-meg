### Reflection
This project spanned over many months while I planned and plotted how I wanted to design and approach its creation. There was a lot of pressure initially, as the work began when I was notified I would be laid off within a few weeks. I threw myself into distraction and trying to build something from scratch. In retrospect, I think I would have taken a bit more time to build a full Figma wireframe for the views as I ended up iterating over different setups multiple times. My goals for this page are:

1. Hand roll a scrolling snap without the use of a library - successful!
2. Design a clean and uncluttered, user friendly site - successful!
3. Implement and play around with Framer Motion - WIP
4. Make site responsive across devices - WIP
